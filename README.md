# Stock-Prediction-with-Scikit-Learn
6 different types of regression models to predict the price of that stock for a future date

# About the project
I  build 6 different types of regression lines to predict stock prices using Scikit Learn.

I loaded historical stocks prices with pandas web-data reader and Yahoo Finance. 

I extract some features like High Low Percentage and Percentage Change.

I clean up and process the data.

I put the data into prediction models.

I evaluate the models using score method in each trained model.

Based on the forecast, I will visualize the plot with our existing historical data.

I was inspired by this article https://towardsdatascience.com/in-12-minutes-stocks-analysis-with-pandas-and-scikit-learn-a8d8a7b50ee7
